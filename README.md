# clipster
A clipboard manager program that lets you paste among the last 30 copied texts. 


Note:

  Run the 'clipster-2.py' file
  
Functionality:
 
1) You can change the hotkey and set it to something of your choice. Change the 'add_hotkey' associated with popup function to change the popup key.
2) You can copy the text by pressing 'CTRL+C' as usual and when you want to paste that text, go to where you want to paste it and instead of pressing 'CTRL+V', press your 'hotkey'(SHIFT+C) and select the text. It would automically get pasted at the location.
  
Background: 
  
I got the inspiration from a another clipboard program, 'CLCL'. When I first started working, I realized how much I copied and pasted in a day. So, I was given the reference of CLCL by my friend. After using CLCL for few days, I realized how something so simple can save your time and it just encouraged me more to take up these type of small developing tasks.

Although, got to admit, CLCL is much more advanced than my 50 something line of code. Maybe in future, I will try to improve upon this.
